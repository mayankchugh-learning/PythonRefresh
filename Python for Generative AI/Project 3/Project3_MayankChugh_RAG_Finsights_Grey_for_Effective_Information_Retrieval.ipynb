        "**Problem Statement:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Finsights Grey Inc. is an innovative financial technology firm that specializes in providing advanced analytics and insights for investment management and financial planning. The company handles an extensive collection of 10-K reports from various industry players, which contain detailed information about financial performance, risk factors, market trends, and strategic initiatives. Despite the richness of these documents, Finsights Grey's financial analysts struggle with extracting actionable insights efficiently in a short span due to the manual and labor-intensive nature of the analysis. Going through the document to find the exact information needed at the moment takes too long. This bottleneck hampers the company's ability to deliver timely and accurate recommendations to its clients. To overcome these challenges, Finsights Grey Inc. aims to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to automate the extraction, summarization, and analysis of information from the 10-K reports, thereby enhancing the accuracy and speed of their investment insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Objective:**\n",
        "\n",
        "As a Gen AI Data Scientist hired by Finsights Grey Inc., the objective is to develop an advanced RAG-based system to streamline the extraction and analysis of key information from 10-K reports. You are asked to deploy a Gradio app on HuggingFace spaces that can RAG 10-k reports and answer the questions of financial analysts swiftly.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project will involve testing the RAG system on a current business problem. The Financial analysts are asked to research major cloud and AI platforms such as Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Meta AI, and IBM Watson to determine the most effective platform for this application. The primary goals include improving the efficiency of data extraction. Once the project is deployed, the system will be tested by a financial analyst with the following questions. Accurate text retrieval for these questions will imply the project's success.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Questions:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Has the company made any significant acquisitions in the AI space, and how are these acquisitions being integrated into the company's strategy?\n",
        "\n",
        "2. How much capital has been allocated towards AI research and development?\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What initiatives has the company implemented to address ethical concerns surrounding AI, such as fairness, accountability, and privacy?\n",
        "\n",
        "4. How does the company plan to differentiate itself in the AI space relative to competitors?\n",
        "\n",
        "Each Question must be asked for each of the five companies on the HuggingFace spaces.\n",

        "Provide timely insights to improve client recommendations.\n",

For additional information, \\nsee Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect and Revenues and Monetization Metrics in Part II, Item 7 of this \\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. \\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of \\nour products, services, and brands as well as affect our ability to compete. \\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for \\nus. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, \\nservices, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country \\nin which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have \\ntaken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection \\nfor our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have \\nadequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the \\npossibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or \\nunenforceable. \\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and \\nother sensitive information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting \\nfrom these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word \\n\\u201cGoogle\\u201d could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word \\u201csearch.\\u201d Some courts have \\nruled that \\\"Google\\\" is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S.,. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to \\nthose described below, which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results, and affect \\nthe trading price of our Class A and Class C stock.\\nRisks Specific to our Company\\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers, a \\nloss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize \\nads could harm our business. \\nWe generated more than 75% of total  revenues from online advertising in 2023. Many of our advertisers, \\ncompanies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their \\ncontracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value \\n(such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective \\nmonetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practice s, such as \\nour initiatives to phase out third-party cookies,  as well as changes to other companies\\u2019 advertising and/or data privacy \\npractices have in the past, and may in the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, \\ntechnologies have been developed that make customized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, \\nand some providers of online services have integrated these technologies that could potentially impair the availability \\nand functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively \\nand competitively could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse \\nmacroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in \\nfluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and \\noperating results. \\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that \\nare useful to users, customers, and other partners, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our \\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results. \\nOur business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing. Table of Contents\\nItem 7. Management\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\nForward-Looking Statements\\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All\\nstatements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial\\nposition, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar\\nexpressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management\\u2019s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual\\nresults and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global\\neconomic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the\\nrate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those\\ninvestments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we\\nowe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes\\nof claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory\\nmanagement, variability in demand, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions\\nand strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and\\nadditional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other\\nrisks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ significantly from management\\u2019s expectations, are described in greater detail in\\nItem 1A of Part I, \\u201cRisk Factors.\\u201d\\nOverview\\nOur primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers.

As such, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not use such AI technologies for improper purposes, including through the\\ndissemination of illegal, inaccurate, defamatory or harmful content, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, furthering bias or discrimination,\\ncybersecurity attacks, data privacy violations, other activities that threaten people's safety or well-being on- or offline, or to develop competing technologies.\\nWhile we may mitigate certain risks associated with the improper use of our AI models through both technical measures and the inclusion of contractual\\nrestrictions on third-party use in any agreement between us and any third party, we cannot guarantee that such measures will be effective. Such improper use by\\nany third party could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results or subject us to legal liability.\\nIt is not possible to predict all of the risks related to the use of AI and changes in laws, rules, directives, and regulations governing the use of AI may\\nadversely affect our ability to develop and use AI or subject us to legal liability.\\n22. social media or other platforms, which could harm our business. It is hard to predict the challenges we may encounter \\nin adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services. We expect to continue \\nto devote significant resources to creating and supporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices. \\nFailing to attract and retain a substantial number of new device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, developers, and \\nusers, or failing to develop products and technologies that work well on new devices and platforms, could harm our \\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results and ability to capture future business opportunities. \\nIssues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational harm and increased liability exposure. \\nOur evolving AI-related efforts may give rise to risks related to harmful content, inaccuracies, discrimination, \\nintellectual property infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity, and other issues . As a \\nresult of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies, our implementation of AI systems could \\nsubject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability (including under new and proposed legislation and \\nregulations), new applications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws, and brand or \\nreputational harm. \\nSome uses of AI will present ethical issues and may have broad effects on society. In order to implement A I \\nresponsibly and minimize unintended harmful effects, we have already devoted and will continue to invest significant  \\nresources to develop, test, and maintain our products and services, but we may not be able to identify or resolve all AI-\\nrelated issues, deficiencies, and/or failures before they arise. Unintended consequences, uses, or customization of our \\nAI tools and systems may negatively affect human rights, privacy, employment, or other social concerns, which may \\nresult in claims, lawsuits, brand or reputational harm, and increased regulatory scrutiny, any of which could harm our \\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results.\\nData privacy  and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could harm our \\nreputation, cause us to incur significant liability, and deter current and potential users or customers from \\nusing our products and services.

In particular, we expect our AI initiatives will\\nrequire increased investment in infrastructure and headcount.\\nThere are significant risks involved in developing and deploying AI and there can be no assurance that the usage of AI will enhance our products or\\nservices or be beneficial to our business, including our efficiency or profitability. For example, our AI-related efforts, particularly those related to generative AI,\\nsubject us to risks related to harmful or illegal content, accuracy, misinformation (including related to elections), bias, discrimination, toxicity, intellectual\\nproperty infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity, and sanctions and export controls, among others. It is also uncertain how\\nvarious laws related to online services, intermediary liability, and other issues will apply to content generated by AI. In addition, we are subject to the risks of\\nnew or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, or other legal liability, ethical concerns, negative consumer perceptions as to automation and\\nAI, activities that threaten people's safety or well-being on- or offline, or other complications that could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial\\nresults.\\nAs a result of the complexity and rapid development of AI, it is also the subject of evolving review by various governmental and regulatory agencies in\\njurisdictions around the world, which are applying, or are considering applying, platform moderation, intellectual property, cybersecurity, and data protection\\nlaws to AI and/or are considering general legal frameworks on AI. We may not always be able to anticipate how courts and regulators will apply existing laws\\nto AI, predict how new legal frameworks will develop to address AI, or otherwise respond to these frameworks as they are still rapidly evolving.

As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may \\nincrease, our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited, and we \\nmay need to change our business practices to comply with evolving regulatory and legal matters . Examples include t he \\nantitrust complaints filed by  the U.S. Department of Justice and a number of state Attorneys General; legislative \\nproposals and pending litigation in the U.S., EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor \\nprotection for websites and online platforms; and the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act in Europe and various \\nlegislative proposals in the U.S. focused on large technology platforms.

Further, certain of our costs and expenses are generally less variable in nature and \\nmay not correlate to changes in revenue. W e may  also not be able to execute our efforts to re-engineer our cost base \\nsuccessfully or in a timely manner. Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue \\ngrowth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance.

Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, \\nservices, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country \\nin which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have \\ntaken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection \\nfor our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have \\nadequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the \\npossibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or \\nunenforceable. \\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and \\nother sensitive information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting \\nfrom these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word \\n\\u201cGoogle\\u201d could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word \\u201csearch.\\u201d Some courts have \\nruled that \\\"Google\\\" is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S.,. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to \\nthose described below, which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results, and affect \\nthe trading price of our Class A and Class C stock.\\nRisks Specific to our Company\\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers, a \\nloss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize \\nads could harm our business. \\nWe generated more than 75% of total  revenues from online advertising in 2023. Many of our advertisers, \\ncompanies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their \\ncontracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value \\n(such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective \\nmonetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practice s, such as \\nour initiatives to phase out third-party cookies,  as well as changes to other companies\\u2019 advertising and/or data privacy \\npractices have in the past, and may in the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, \\ntechnologies have been developed that make customized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, \\nand some providers of online services have integrated these technologies that could potentially impair the availability \\nand functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively \\nand competitively could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse \\nmacroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in \\nfluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and \\noperating results. \\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that \\nare useful to users, customers, and other partners, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our \\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results. \\nOur business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive.
