1,Here's the Thing about the M3 Macbook Air...,"Intro
(Intro music)
- That's crazy that the most interesting things
about this new laptop are the reasons not to buy it.
So the MacBook Air just got refreshed.
It's a pretty simple update, maybe a boring one actually.
Whats New
There's really only two things new.
It has this new anodization on the outside,
apparently a slightly more fingerprint resistant look to it.
And it has the new M3 chip inside.
So the coating, I don't know,
it barely makes a difference if I'm being honest.
It still gets fingerprints if you handle it regularly
without a skin or a case.
I would much rather depend on something like a skin
from channel sponsor Dbrand.
It lets you break out from one of the three
really simple colors and it's gonna hide fingerprints
a million times better than any metal treatment ever could.
Plus these are real leather,
so they have a nice plush texture
and it'll patina over time.
So I'll leave a link to this one below.
But the other new thing is this M3 chip inside.
So we've seen this M3 chip before, this is what Apple does.
They put the same chip everywhere.
This came out in October of last year
and they immediately put it in the new iMac.
And then we also got a new MacBook Pro that launched
with this and the M3 PRO and the M3 Max.
So okay, new M3 Apple silicon, third generation, great.
So now we're finally getting this new base M3 chip
in the new MacBook Air, side note, why does it take so long?
I don't know, it feels like Apple kind of staggers it
probably on purpose, but like it's the same chip everywhere.
They've done the iMac, they've done the MacBook Pro
and MacBook Air, but the Mac Mini just staying
on M2, kind of weird.
Also the new iPad Pro still on M2.
When's that gonna get it?
Anyway, you already know that the MacBook Air
is the most popular Mac for a reason.
This is the base like entry level Mac
that most people are seeing
as the way to get into the Mac world.
And so the base MacBook Air has typically been one
of the easiest to recommend laptops in the world by design.
But this one, interestingly, for two reasons, isn't.
Performance
Now, this has nothing to do with performance of M3
or anything weird like that.
Like it's the performance you were expecting.
If you look at benchmarks, it's right around that 10
to 20% improvement over M2
depending on what you're doing.
Definitely leans heavier
on graphics improvements this generation.
And there's the rate tracing now finally.
So any applications
or rendering that are taken advantage of that,
that's gonna be a noticeable improvement for M3.
And it's clearly a more capable chip.
And also MacBook Airs, especially the 15 inch,
just constantly get great battery life across the board.
You also get now dual external display support
with the lid closed,
but one external display with the laptop open.
And it also appears
that the base storage on M3 is much improved.
So this was one of those concerns from,
if you look back at M2,
you know obviously Apple seeds reviewers
with higher end MacBooks, so most of us aren't getting that.
But if you look back at M2
the base 256 gig model used a single SSD module instead
of two SSDs.
Long story short, that storage module was way slower
than M1, like 50% slower on paper.
Would you have noticed if nobody told you
and had never benchmarked it?
Maybe, possibly not,
but obviously it's a bummer having way slower storage
on a new M2 and that extra time transferring large files,
that adds up over time.
So I'm happy to report that I've seen really good benchmarks
on the base storage of the M3 Air.
It appears that they fixed it, awesome.
So what's the deal with this M3 Air then?
Why am I saying it's not necessarily
the best recommendation?
Well, historically, MacBook Air has been super easy
to recommend, but with this M3,
they also lowered the price of M2 by a hundred bucks
and discontinued the M1.
Price
So now the lineup is M3 MacBook Air starts at 1099,
then M2 MacBook Air starts at 999
and then M1, it's kind of gone from Apple,
but you can still find stock
that's left at like Walmart or Best Buy.
Now the thing about the MacBook Air being easy
to recommend is we're talking about regular people,
which it's very light, regular,
normal usage like web browsing, listening to music, a bunch
of tabs open, work stuff, occasionally compiling
or rendering some small things, photo editing
and chopping a video or two sometimes,
but really very light.
So these people, like type of people
who would buy a laptop at Walmart would be totally fine
with the cheaper identical looking MacBook Air
with the slightly slower M2 chip and slower storage.
I think they would be totally fine.
But the other thing which I need to talk about
Base spec
is this whole base spec thing.
This is not exactly new to the industry, but the base price
and the base spec has almost become like this weird fallacy.
Like I think it was Linus who did a video
about how starting at is like the biggest lie in tech.
And he's right, it's not just tech,
like the car industry does it all the time too.
Starting at, you know, this super low price,
but nobody actually gets it at that price.
You're not gonna get a totally bare base model car.
The base price is really more to give you an idea
of how much you're about to spend
when you actually option it up the way you want to.
And the issue with these is Apple's markup prices
for above base spec is crazy high.
Apple markup
Like Apple charges way too much for the most basic upgrades.
Obviously Apple Silicon computers are all a system
on a chip, so they cannot be upgraded ever
after you buy them, right?
So once you buy it, you know, you're kind
of incentivized if you're gonna keep it for a long time
to splurge a little bit
and give yourself some extra headroom and future proof it
and bump up that spec.
But Apple charges so much for bumping up that spec
that the base price feels like kind of even more
of a lie than usual.
So the MacBook Air starts in 2024,
again, at eight gigs of shared RAM and 256 gigs of storage.
Now, ignoring the fact that the phone I'm using also has
more than eight gigs of RAM
and 256 gigs of storage, if you want to upgrade to 16 gigs
of memory, the first available RAM upgrade, that's $200.
And if you wanna bump up to just the half a terabyte
of storage, that's another 200 more dollars.
Compared to to how much that actually costs Apple,
especially at the scale that they're operating,
that is just crazy, brutal, ridiculous pricing.
So even if you do just that,
suddenly the MacBook Air M3 is $1,500.
So either you're cool with knowing you're actually buying
a 1500 plus dollars MacBook Air or the real question is,
is the base spec in 2024 actually usable?
Conclusion
And my take is actually sometimes yes, sometimes yes.
So again, if you're the people I talked about earlier,
you're you're buying a laptop from the showcase at Walmart
or Best Buy, you just need it to do the basic stuff
I mentioned earlier,
you actually can do that with eight gigs
of shared memory, no problem.
This might seem like a hot take,
but I've spent a lot of time doing this stuff.
You rarely actually get close to hitting the max
and hitting memory swap.
And even when you do, it's very much still fine.
It's when you get into the heavier stuff like media encoding
or exporting or gaming that it's a whole nother story.
So if you're watching this video,
you already know which group of people you're in.
So for that massive group of people who are doing a lot of
that normal, baseline computing stuff,
don't buy the new M3 MacBook Air.
You can very easily get an M2 MacBook Air
and save your money.
Matter of fact, if you don't need the brighter display,
the MagSafe, the external display support,
which you probably don't at this rate,
it's also a great idea to look into Best Buy
or Walmart's like six, $700 M1 MacBook Airs
that they're selling right now.
I think Walmart first announced they would have it for 699
and then a few days later Best Buy announced
that they'd sell it for 649, which is pretty sick.
So clearly M3 is a much more capable overall chip
and brings the floor of a laptop up.
But the way I see it, what Apple silicon has done
to Apple's lineup is it's brought down the minimum level
of machine that you can get away with doing your workflow.
Does that make sense?
So like me, I edit a lot of videos
and so I need a powerful machine for Final Cut Pro
and that sort of stuff, right?
So for the longest time I could only use an Apple Desktop,
the highest end iMac Pro, the Mac Pro, and I still will,
but I am now able to use Mac Studio and I can actually edit.
I've had an M1 Max MacBook Pro for a while
and I've been editing on the go with a laptop,
which is a huge like enabler for me.
And the same sort of thing applies if you're doing like
gaming stuff or if you have a whole bunch of coding
and heavy, maybe even just encoding photos
or whatever you're doing at that level,
you'd typically rely on a MacBook Pro.
But with these new chips and with Apple silicon,
you can do that on a high-end MacBook Air, which is again,
a pretty sweet enabler.
So that's what the new M3 MacBook Air is.
If you do that sort of stuff, it's an amazing computer.
It should be on your shortlist.
Great all around, easy to recommend.
But again, if you're doing the lightweight, normal stuff
and you need a MacBook Air, don't get this one.
Get the cheaper one.
Okay, that's it.
Thanks for watching.
Catch you guys the next one, peace.

2,"15"" MacBook Air M2 Review: The Obvious Thing!","Intro
(upbeat music)
- What's up?
MKBHD here and welcome
to the 15-inch MacBook Air review.
This laptop, thankfully, is exactly what you think it is.
It's a MacBook Air, but bigger.
This is the Tesla Model Y of laptops.
Tesla Model Y
You see the Tesla Model 3
was the most important model for Tesla.
They had other more expensive flagships,
but this was the entry level,
attainable version for the masses,
and it quickly became their most recommended
and best-selling car.
And it's the way that most people got into Tesla
and formed their first Tesla experience.
But sneakily, bigger cars are actually more popular
and in America especially, people can't help,
but want a version that's a little bigger,
a little higher off the ground.
So they did the obvious thing and made Tesla model Y.
It's built on the same platform as a Model 3,
but a little bigger and a little higher off the ground
and pretty much instantly has rocketed up
to the top of the lineup to the point
where it's now the most popular new car on planet Earth.
(tape rewinding)
See, the MacBook Air was the most important Mac for Apple.
I mean, they had other expensive flagships,
but this was the most entry level
attainable model for the masses.
And it quickly became their most recommended
and best-selling Mac.
And it's the first way most people got into the Mac
and formed their first Mac OS experiences.
But sneakily, bigger screens are actually,
the most popular and in America especially,
people can't help but want a version
with a little bit of a bigger screen.
So, they did the obvious thing
and made the 15-inch MacBook Air.
It's built on the same platform as the 14-inch MacBook Air,
but a little bit bigger screen,
and I predict it'll pretty much instantly
rocket to the top of the lineup
to the point where it is the most popular 15-inch laptop
and the most popular Mac on planet Earth.
We kinda already know what the M2 MacBook Air is.
If you haven't already seen it,
I'll link the review right below the light button
that covers it.
My only real questions going into the review
of the bigger one were,
one, is there any real benefit to the bigger screen?
How much better is it really?
And two, are there any other benefits
to getting a bigger laptop?
The Bigger Screen
So, I think the whole bigger screen thing is pretty clear.
There are literally millions of people
who today go into stores and ask for a 15-inch laptop,
and when they did, Apple would have to bring people
over to the 16-inch MacBook Pro as their cheapest option,
which starts at $2,500.
So, now they have this.
Now, is there a dramatically more information
that can fit on the screen?
Not really.
Is it a dramatically better quality display
than the smaller one?
Nah, it mostly just feels bigger.
Bigger videos, bigger movies, bigger texts,
bigger windows, just just a little more room
for everything to be a little bit bigger.
And you only pay for that really
with a little bit of exercise as far as the laptop goes.
This thing is still 11 and a half millimeters thin
and weighs 3.3 pounds.
It's super slim.
It's a quarter of a millimeter thicker
and half a pound heavier than the smaller MacBook Air,
which I kinda mentioned this earlier,
but I forgot that basically,
already has 14-inch diagonal screens
with its thinner bezels.
So, you can really just measure out
1.3 extra inches diagonally
to get to the proper 15.3 inch laptop size.
Still, it has decently thin bezels,
not the thinnest in the world,
still has the notch cutout for face ID.
I mean, sorry, no face ID.
It has just a webcam and a microphone.
It still just has touch ID on the keyboard
and nothing else about
the display itself really has changed.
It's the same tech, the same pixel density,
the same brightness, 500 nits, 60 hertz.
It's fine, the screen is fine.
It's just bigger.
So all right, now that the whole footprint
The Bigger Build
of the laptop is also bigger,
what more can you get out of that?
First of all, sneaky, slightly bigger trackpad.
So, the keyboard is the same size,
but actually, the trackpad does get a little bit bigger,
which is nice.
Kind of matches the larger display.
And also, there is more room inside for speakers.
So, Apple's added not bigger speakers,
but just actually, a second set of force-canceling woofers,
which would theoretically make the sound
a little punchier, maybe add some bass.
And I can say it is louder.
It does get louder overall
and have a bit more bass than the smaller MacBook Air,
but it's not like game changing.
I'm impressed that they can get louder without distorting,
but they are not close to the maybe
unfair 16-inch MacBook Pro speakers.
But just to give you an idea of the context.
Also, some people have noted it looks kind of weird
to have like no speaker grills
to the left and right of the keyboard,
but the speakers are still in the same place
as they were on the smaller one.
up in the hinge of the MacBook Air.
And then there's also more room inside for bigger battery.
And my experience actually lines up pretty well
with what Apple said, which is,
look, it's the same chip set,
very similar laptop, bigger screen
and bigger battery sort of cancel each other out.
And you end up with roughly
the same battery life as a smaller machine.
And that's to say it's quite good,
full workday of battery life pretty much guaranteed,
multiple light days in a row.
No problem.
So, then the last thing I wanted to test is,
actually, is there a difference in performance
between the small M2 MacBook Air and the big one?
Since theoretically, there's just a little more room inside
for a little extra thermal headroom.
Thermals
Like there's no way it's significant,
but these are very different sized laptops
and the old one when it was torn apart,
didn't have a heatsink.
So maybe there's room for
a little passive heatsink in this one.
They're both fan less, but I had to check it.
So, in single core bursty performance,
I never expect to see any difference and I really didn't.
I ran off back to back Geekbench 6 benchmarks,
small drop off after the first one for each,
but no noticeable difference.
But then I ran back to back
10 minute Cinebench multi-core benchmarks,
which kind of just run continuously
to test some more reliable sustained workloads.
And there was a slightly bigger dip
on the smaller M2 Air.
And so potentially, yes, over time
this may add up to a bit more thermal throttling.
But my conclusion is, you can see the numbers on paper,
but this difference is unlikely to be noticeable.
Like I said, they're both running the M2 chip
and most behavior on laptops like this
is so bursty and short that
they perform basically identically.
But if you do happen to get into
those long multi-minute sustained workloads in a row,
like exporting a video, editing a video, gaming even,
then maybe you'd notice
a little bit more out of this bigger one over time.
But you'll notice a bigger difference
on the 14-inch MacBook Pro,
which is just a little bit above this one in price.
So, if you know you're gonna be doing workloads like that
then you probably are looking at a Pro laptop.
And matter of fact, let's just talk about
what I think is the biggest X-factor with this laptop.
The biggest hurdle between this
and being the Tesla Model Y of laptops, is the price.
So, this baseline version, this a little Starlight one,
which kind of almost matches this a little bit,
little sand color, starts at 1,299.
Price
And that is the base version,
which you can't upgrade these laptops over time.
So, you tend to wanna get as much as you can
out of the initial purchase.
This base version only has eight gigs of shared memory
and 256 gigs of storage
that can actually pretty quickly become a $1,700 laptop
with just a few clicks to upgrade those things.
And that's pricey.
So, there's a lot of Windows laptops that you can get
at that price that will probably do
one specific thing better than this one,
whether it's the XPF 15 with a nicer display
or the ROG Zephyrus,
which is gonna be better for gaming and has more ports.
You can get flipping and folding laptops
that spin over backwards and gaming laptops even.
But none of them will be quite the package that this is,
which is a really thin and light
daily 15-inch screen laptop,
like this is kind of just
the ultimate baseline for most people's activities.
So, to have all those things sort of well-rounded into one,
the thinness and lightness, the nice display,
the great battery life,
the impressive performance from the M2,
that's what makes this the MacBook Air.
It's got the A1 build quality,
it's got the color matching braided MagSafe cable,
which also connects to the 35 watt charging brick
with dual USB-C ports,
which you could actually swap out
for a slightly larger 70 watt brick
with a single port for faster charging.
That's a free swap on Apple site.
And of course, you can't forget the ecosystem stuff,
the messages, the FaceTime, et cetera,
all the stuff that plugs into Apple's world.
Despite its potentially premium price,
people will pounce on this popular pick.
Thanks for watching.
Catch you guys the next one.
Peace.
(upbeat jazz music)
"
3,Apple finally got revenge - MacBook Air M2,"this is a MacBook Air M1 it's an
interesting color I would call this more
of a salmon than like a rose gold or
anything this is the old style chassis
you got the wedge you got two ports on
the side here I think you got nothing
over here aside from a headphone jack
yep and it's the same old MacBook Air we
all know and perhaps love what I have in
here
brand new
M2 MacBook Air for whatever reason we
still have it in a shipping box so I'm
just gonna get this out of here what how
does this even work oh okay
oh yeah it's one of these fancy Apple
shipping boxes it is
a big L most MacBooks you just see the
front of it but the MacBook Air they've
always shown the side profiles to show
how thin it is and I guess in this case
they've chosen it open to show that it's
even thinner because it has to be
thinner than the last gen every time
except I don't think it is this time on
the back of the box we can see that we
have a base model spec I believe this is
eight gigs of unified memory with a 256
Specs
gig SSD so this is going to be slow by
comparison to the 512 or higher SSD 8
core CPU and 8 core GPU so I think the
higher spec version has a 10 core GPU if
I'm not mistaken and that's about all
you got on the back of the box
just like with the MacBook Pro I don't
think you'll find M2 listed anywhere on
the back of this box
Apple stop okay here let's do a
a peel of sorts
yeah there we go man I said there was
something in the air there's also grass
in the air I'm allergic to grass so if
I'm a little loopy or that's why here we
go this is the oh this is the the new
like midnight black is that what it's
called Midnight that is black like for
comparison that's space gray if you like
black laptops you're gonna love this
Size Comparison
they are very similar in terms of size
that's interesting the feet I think help
give it more height it rests the same
height so the the lids are about the
same height off of the desk but uh the
area is thinner along with our two
Thunderbolt 4 ports we have magsafe
which is something you don't get on the
M2 Pro you can actually get better
expansion out of the M2 air simply
because you don't have to plug in a
charger or a power delivery capable dock
which is a nice feature and on the other
side we just have that headphone jack
which I think is high impedance I'm not
entirely sure and I mean that's really
all there is to the MacBooks exterior
like oh there there's a little bit of
Engraving there you can see for the uh I
guess the model and serial number one of
the things that makes the new Air stand
out from the old air is the old Air had
that wedge shape whereas the new one is
entirely flat let's take a look at the
keyboard
and I know it's going to power on yeah
oh but it looks so good like this
colorway look at it there is a touch ID
sensor for your fingerprint the keys
themselves I think they're the same Keys
you would find on this 14 inch pro
they feel pretty much the same if you
would like to learn how to use
voiceovers stop
well wait for this to set up let's get
into the rest of the box here because I
kind of Dove right in on the laptop so
we've got this here charger this is a 30
watt charger probably make this smaller
with the correct gallium nitride
Arrangement this is mag safe it's
supposed to not tangle as much with what
with the braiding and all but it kind of
angled on me it's kind of amazing how
shallow the current gen magsafe is
that is
a perfect match and of course it's
magsafe so
why does it do dark mode out of the box
it knows what model this is it should
know what color it is too there we go
now it matches I think the air is a
little bit brighter it could just be
that the screen is actually just bigger
which is a huge advantage to the MacBook
Air compared to the MacBook Pro the the
bezel sorry I got sidetracked with the
universal control feature well what was
I saying um Benadryl the MacBook Air has
Display
a 13.6 inch screen whereas the MacBook
Pro has a 13.3 inch screen there's much
less bezel around the edges you do have
the notch but you get this extra screen
real estate up here for free plus you
don't have the menu bar in that viewable
area on the pro on the air 2560 by 1600
on this guy 2560 by 1664 on this guy
those extra 64 pixels are the menu bar
at the top Pros display is srgb whereas
this one is DCI P3 do you see that
stuttering on the MacBook Pro yeah
you're right this looks like yeah yeah
this looks really bad it's not running
in 60 FPS god what the hell is wrong
Issues
with this thing for a minute I was
convinced that the MacBook Air had 120
hertz panel the reason being the MacBook
Pro is stuttering and I have no idea why
now this battery is not fully charged
it's at like 25 there's nothing going on
in activity monitor they both have the
same
brightness setup right now I don't know
kind of ridiculous for an Apple device
you never get that
the UFO test still thinks that it's 60
hertz over here too but it is it is
definitely 60 hertz over here supposedly
these have the same color spaces given
the the billion color uh claim but the
xdr obviously is xdr this is just a flat
display
okay let's get the uh M1 MacBook Air
opened up here I mean we have to test
the speakers of course
[Music]
Speaker Test
it's actually really good
[Music]
interesting it seems like it's more
balanced it's pretty good 400 nits 500
nits of course you're still not getting
that HDR I wonder what dbrand is going
to do with the new MacBooks thanks to
dbrand for sponsoring this video they
sent over some special skins that
they're only going to be oh limit
limited time oh my God is this actually
a product
book 2022 M2 oh my God it's Greg book
Craigbook
you asked for this we don't know why
while watching WWDC we had two questions
for Apple what the hell are you doing
with these Transitions and how can we
profit off them typical dbrand they can
only answer one of these questions and
it's by turning Craig into an M2 MacBook
skin
Jesus
I'm I'm not surprised I'm sorry dbrand
you told me to be surprised I'm not
surprised this is
is normal for you now if you guys are
crazy like the people at dbrand go to
dbrand.com craigbook and buy this I
guess
or don't you can buy other dbrand skins
that are less ugly but apparently they
want you to buy this one so buy this one
just do it okay I guess next we'll do a
webcam test I believe this is using a
720p whereas this is a 1080p FaceTime
camera comparing the webcam between
Webcam Comparison
these two it looks like the 1080p
FaceTime camera is an upgrade over the
720p but it's not as big an upgrade as
you might think it is the image
processing is very similar on both
um wait
okay yeah we're looking at different
walls Benadryl it's surprising how good
the signal processing is on the Apple
silicon platform it's just really good
this is the elephant in the room when it
comes to the new Macbook Air this
MacBook Air M1 has a 256 gig SSD this
MacBook Air M2 has a 256 gig SSD what
Apple did was they switched from having
a multi-chip to having a single chip SSD
for the same capacity at 256 gigs and
you can see already that our performance
is not super amazing we've got 3387
megabytes per second read sequential on
the M1 pretty much exactly half that a
little bit more than half that on the M2
these speeds are still very high now it
looks like the random reads I think
that's Q depth one is pretty close
Suggestions
that's a good sign for General usability
and that's probably why Apple felt that
it was okay to do this actually it looks
like the M2 is a little bit faster than
the M1 in terms of random rights and
that might make a little bit of sense
that storage controller might actually
be a little more capable if you're going
to buy a MacBook Air I would suggest
buying the upper end model versus the
base model because the upper end model I
think comes with a 512 gig SSD which
would be faster and it comes with those
extra GPU cores which are definitely
faster and the better charger just
upgrading the storage alone is a 200
upgrade on the Us website that makes it
a no-brainer to get the higher end model
straight up like why would you buy the
base model Creative Cloud alone
we'll take a big chunk of that as will
xcode as will Final Cut and that all
adds up I I would prefer the extra room
afforded by a 512 gig SSD personally you
can also get a one terabyte or two
terabyte SSD as well instead of just the
512 I would probably upgrade the memory
personally eight gigs is not a lot 16
should be standard okay let's grab
the M2 Pro as well
Benchmarking
three two one
obviously we know that the M2 equipped
Pro is slower than the M1 Pro equipped
MacBook Pro it should be faster than the
M1 equipped MacBook Air as it was then
the N1 equipped MacBook Pro honestly I
don't know why they couldn't fit a fan
into the MacBook Air like a tiny little
fan I guess they just didn't want the
whiny noise it already looks like
cinebench is going to complete in a very
similar time frame in any situation
where you're not racing to sleep the M2
air is going to be just as fast as the
M2 Pro I don't understand why this
exists yeah I'm looking at the pricing
here for the base model MacBook Pro 13.
Pricing
it's a little more expensive than the
base model MacBook Air but you do get
that 10 core GPU and you get a fan and
the touch bar if you care about that
which are the only real upgrades you're
getting over the MacBook Air for the
upgraded MacBook Air you're looking at
14.99 and to get the same upgrade you're
looking at 14.99 for the MacBook Pro
why so for the pro you're getting
a fan the touch bar at the expense of
the function keys which are full height
this time instead of these half height
things on the old errors and you're
getting a slightly better battery I like
the air a lot better than I like the pro
and if you're already looking at buying
a Macbook I would say buying MacBook Air
instead of the MacBook Pro at least for
the 13 inch model with that being said I
guess now we take it apart
maybe I'll end up breaking it wouldn't
that be great I've got a body count
going you know
[Music]
picks
[Music]
oh this is always really annoying
getting this to move okay so I think it
pulls this way
there we go
Internals
four screws battery a force touch track
pad okay there's our speakers
those speakers are actually larger than
I expected they would be it's not as
held down as I would expect for an Apple
device I think this is all mostly
heatsink to be honest
with graphite tape yeah one thing that
I've always really liked about Apple's
designs is that they've always gone out
of their way to make the internal look
nice even though they don't expect or
want anybody to ever look at it neat
well I'm not going to take the battery
out or the cooler off because we're
gonna have to test The Thermals and
everything on this later I've seen
people ask me like oh well you opened it
up you disturbed The Thermals
oh
engage those clips
First Aid?
oh
oh
I tore a big strip off my thumb
well if you liked this uh injurious uh
short circuit uh hit like and get
subscribed make sure you check out some
more of them there are plenty of them
not all of them contain Grievous bodily

4,M2 MacBook Air Review: More Than a Refresh!,"(upbeat music)
- All right, what's up? MKBHD here.
So tick-tock.
That's what just happened to the MacBook Air.
Not TikTok, not the short form video website.
But two years ago,
we had a thin, wedge-shaped, Intel-powered MacBook Air,
super popular laptop.
But that was also the beginning
of the Apple silicon transition.
And that transition to designing their own silicon
would mean they could unlock levels of optimization
and streamlining that were never before possible
when using an off-the-shelf chip from Intel.
So first, they replaced the Intel chip with an M1 chip
in the wedge-shaped MacBook Air, tick.
Now they've redesigned the entire computer
around apple silicon with M2, tock.
So theoretically, this is more than just a refresh,
this is our first look at what's possible with Apple
in a thin and light form factor,
now that they finally designed the silicon
and everything around it.
And it's also deceivingly expensive
but we'll get to that in a second.
So with Apple's most popular Mac,
I fully expect a level of,
if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
But to their credit,
they have changed and updated mostly everything
about this design and for the better.
The wedge shape used to taper to appear
and feel thinner at the edges,
but now the whole thing is flat,
it's 11 millimeters all the way across,
which is actually thinner overall
and I really like it this way.
This is one of those shapes
that you just feel like you can pick up and take everywhere,
truly ultra portable.
They've thinned out the bezels around the new display,
which let them bump it up a bit to 13.6 inches diagonally.
There's a notch in the top middle,
which has become a part of Apple's design language
at this point, but that quickly fades away to invisible
when you're actually using the laptop.
And it's housing a new 1080p webcam, that looks fine.
I mean, for sure better than the old one.
Also, the display is way better,
it has a higher 500 nit max brightness
and a lower minimum brightness
for working in dim environments,
which I actually found really useful
when publishing the Nothing Phone review
at five o'clock in the morning here.
They also added MagSafe,
plus the color-matching braided cable,
which is a nice touch.
By the way, they do include the Midnight-colored stickers
with the Midnight-colored laptop,
that's another nice touch.
But the MagSafe charger also just means
you freed up another USB type C port,
and you also get that fast charging at up to 67 watts,
which is nice because the battery,
again, makes this a very long-lasting laptop.
I'll still say the M2 MacBook Pro,
which is thicker,
is still gonna be an overall battery champ.
But I mean the 15 hours of claimed web browsing
translated for me to an entire workday of use
with 20 plus percent left.
It was awesome,
and if I had several light days in a row with it,
I needn't even really think about charging, it's great.
It's not perfect though.
I do still wish that they'd put USB type C on both sides.
But, as of right now,
it's two USB type C Thunderbolt 3 on the left,
headphone jack on the right.
And so, it only supports one external monitor,
and if you do have an external monitor,
it'll probably have to be to the left.
And then, when I first got hands-on with this thing,
I was very curious about the speakers,
'cause as you can see, they are pretty much invisible,
unless you know where to look.
But they are right up in the hinge of this laptop
so I was curious if they'd be any good.
And I guess I shouldn't be surprised
but turns out they sound really good, they sound great.
Not as much bass and thump as the bigger laptops,
like the MacBook Pros, but still very, very loud
and more than enough for media consumption,
that type of thing, music, watching videos,
all that sort of stuff.
The one thing that turns out to be a downer here,
as much as I've wanted to love it, is this new color.
So the M2 MacBook Air now comes in Silver and Space Gray,
like before, then there's a new Starlight color,
which is a very faded gold.
And then, this, which is Midnight.
Midnight is a very, very dark blue
and it absolutely changes how much blue it shows
based on the environment you're in,
like if the light hits it just right,
it can look like a blue laptop,
but in some environments,
it just looks like a matte black laptop,
which I think is sick.
But we were right in the first impressions,
this one is an absolute fingerprint magnet
the instant you start using it,
and it's impossible to keep clean.
But then on top of that, there are some durability concerns.
The normal wear and tear on the trackpad area seems fine
and I've only had this for a week
so I can't really test a long time use.
But what we saw on the review unit
that I had a couple weeks ago
or the first impressions unit was around those ports,
the USB-C port and MagSafe ports,
if you miss plugging it in enough times,
you're gonna scratch the paint and it'll be most noticeable
on this dark laptop because it has silver underneath.
So I guess there's three solutions.
One, don't get this color,
two, if you do get this color,
maybe protect it with a case or a dbrand skin,
that's my personal preference,
there's lots of great dbrand skins
to make the back of the laptop, especially,
not look so ridiculous.
Or three, take really, really good care of it.
But overall though, the new design, I like it a lot.
It is remarkably thin,
it's not the thinnest and lightest laptop in the world,
but it's one of those
like I could carry it everywhere type things.
I love using it every day.
It makes me kind of jealous
because I, in my normal workflow,
regularly do video editing on a laptop now,
so I carry around this huge 16 inch laptop.
But yeah, if I didn't have to do that,
I would love to carry this around.
So it's fantastic.
But speaking of workflow and horsepower,
we've now also seen already what the new M2 chip
inside this thing is truly capable of
because we also took a look at
the M2 MacBook Pro, and we love it,
we love the CPU improvement,
the GPU improvement is even more substantial,
and the new higher end media engine
coming down to M2 is awesome for video workflows,
especially in Apple's optimized apps,
it's just better than M1 across the board.
But now the most popular thing
that everyone's been wondering,
that the most common question I got
when I asked on Twitter, Instagram,
I asked you guys what you wanted to know
about this laptop is,
what's the difference in performance
between the M2 chip in a fan-cooled system,
like the M2 MacBook Pro,
and in the fanless system, that is the MacBook Air?
Because in the short bursty stuff,
it keeps up with the MacBook Pro just fine.
They are very similar in performance
with short, repetitive quick stuff, up to a couple minutes.
But at some point, with a sustained workload,
this laptop is gonna get so hot without a fan
that it has to throttle to not overheat.
And this one with a fan
will keep going at its normal performance.
Where is that point?
And so, I tried it with some benchmarks,
I've done it with some real world applications.
And it turns out that that point
is somewhere around five minutes.
Seems pretty short, but when you think about it,
that's a lot of sustained load.
So that's not photo editing, that's not web browsing
or even like coding or short bursty like benchmark stuff,
a two minute benchmark won't show that difference here.
I'm talking about like video editing or long renders
when you have background rendering on
for 5, 10, 15 minutes in a row, gaming even,
things that light up all of the cores all at once
for several minutes in a row sustained.
And that is where the MacBook Air really gets tested.
I noticed it actually heats up
quite a bit right in the middle.
So if your laptop's on your bare legs on your lap,
you're gonna feel that.
But yeah, that's where you hit the difference
between the M2 MacBook Pro and the M2 MacBook Air.
But this is also kind of hilarious and impressive to me
because we can't forget what this machine actually is,
which is it's a MacBook Air, it's the baseline,
it's the entry level of their laptop lineup.
So the fact that we're considering
if it can handle maybe four strings of 4K video editing
at once, or like big, long renders,
or projects over a certain size is kind of amazing.
Like, I saw Brian Tong, shout out to him and his videos,
he did a giant 45 minute 20 video track 20 audio track
4K export in Premiere to really see the difference
between the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro.
By the way, the difference was like 10 minutes.
So thank you for going through that for us, Brian.
But yeah, that's incredible
because that's clearly not what this machine is really for,
it's for the everyday use of 30 Chrome tabs
or 15 apps open at once
but not really rendering or doing any sustained loads,
just like a bunch of normal stuff going on.
So basically, the one thing
going against this MacBook Air for me is the price.
Okay, so this laptop starts at 1,199, so $1,200,
which is already $200 more than the M1 MacBook Air is,
which stays in the lineup, by the way.
It was a pretty good laptop when it came out, still is.
That's a thousand, so this is 1,200.
But the baseline version also has the same SSD issue
that the baseline M2 MacBook Pro had.
Meaning the 256 gig version,
which uses a single SSD module instead of two smaller ones,
is significantly slower than the rest of the lineup.
Literally half the speed and that's not insignificant.
Remember, the base version
also has just eight gigs of memory, right?
And the M2 system on a chip means that
shared memory is for the entire system.
So if you're doing enough,
you can actually fill up that memory pretty quickly,
which is when it starts to swap over and use the SSD.
And when that happens, things actually start to feel slower
on this base model.
So it costs another 200 bucks to upgrade it to 512 gigs,
that's the version I've been testing
and that's what it should have started at
in the first place.
Now you're sitting at 1,400 bucks.
And 1,400 bucks is not the same,
like super easy, magical $1,000 price point
like we had with the last generation, that's a lot more.
So here's how I think about this.
If you are someone who's actually considering
buying the new MacBook Air,
I would just consider this a $1,500 laptop.
Any less, if you don't wanna spend that much,
then you probably should be looking at the M1 MacBook Air,
it's still a $1,000, still in the lineup,
still a great laptop.
But if you're looking higher up for certain reasons,
just know that the 14 inch MacBook Pro
is just sitting right there waiting for you at $2,000.
Obviously, this is very strategic by Apple
and the way they've priced all this is well thought out,
I guess you could say.
But the point is if you're planning to do
a lot more of that creative stuff,
higher end workflows, sustained loads,
the 14 inch MacBook Pro is a way better laptop.
If I wanna spec up this MacBook Air up to a way
where I think it'll be very comfortable
for a couple of years doing this creative stuff,
so you're gonna add the 10 core GPU,
you're gonna go up to two terabytes of storage,
you're gonna max it out, let's say 24 gigs of memory,
which is the new max for the M2, that's already over $2,000.
And that'll be a really, really nice MacBook Air
and a lot of people who get it are gonna love it.
But the 14 inch MacBook Pro runs circles around this laptop
at the same price, and it has a way nicer screen,
for that creative stuff,
it has ports for that creative stuff,
and it has an SD card slot,
which is what most of that creative stuff is gonna need
if you're doing that.
So I would suggest considering it.
So it's a little bit deceivingly pricey,
but the sweet spot for this MacBook Air
is right around $1,500,
and I think if that's the one you're considering,
that's the one you should go with.
There's gonna be lots of people around that spec
that I think are gonna really love it.
But other than that, that's been my review
of the fingerprintiest laptop we've ever seen,
aside from all the other matte black laptops.
Anyway, that's been it.
Thanks for watching.
Catch you guys in the next one, peace.

5,M2 MacBook Air vs. The Rest,"i have an interesting story so two years

ago in 2020 i did a video that was kind

of like this one right i was comparing

the 2020 macbook air against some

windows alternatives

and i reached out to some companies i

was like hey i'm doing this video and

they would send me these review units i

kind of checked them out picked up my

favorites and i made the video with that

but the following year 2021

i was trying to do the same thing but

this time around apple had their m1

macbook air

and

i reached out to some companies

things were a little bit different this

time so a lot of companies were like hey

we'll pass this year like thanks for the

consideration we appreciate it but we'll

we'll skip this year

and like i'm just gonna pause for a

second think about what the companies

were doing

they had an opportunity to showcase a

laptop of their choosing against the m1

macbook air and they were skipping

because they knew they knew that that

apple product was so good it was well

priced 999 dollars fantastic performance

great keyboard great screen killer

battery life like record-breaking

battery life you just had this giga chad

laptop that you just don't want to go up

against so so many companies were just

like nah we're not gonna do it this year

um

but 2022

we went out again asked the companies

and a lot of companies this year wanted

to put something into the ring so here

we have it now this year i think the

reason why this is happening is because

windows laptops are a lot better but

it's also the pricing this product from

apple is twelve hundred dollars at the

base and it's like twelve or thirteen

hundred dollars it's a little bit more

if you wanna get like a non-gimped

version of this product so it's a more

expensive device with better products to

choose from in the windows camp we got

ourselves a video okay the m2 macbook

air is a very nice laptop it's super

thin it's super light it has magsafe

charging it's got a great keyboard with

touch id solid trackpad even such a thin

device and the screen with its notch is

a fantastic display that's rocking a

1080p webcam it has a better cpu than m1

a much better gpu than m1 but it's still

a fanless system so if you push the

system super hard it'll throttle at the

top end but this overall is a fantastic

laptop it's just expensive it's 12 or

1300 bucks to start

and it goes up but this year there's

some really nice windows devices that

are very comparable in terms of the

experience that you're getting

these are three of my favorites so the

first is the xps 13 plus this to me is

the best looking windows laptop on the

market and it's a very powerful system

they've engineered this chassis from the

ground up to be able to pump more

wattage into the chip and cool it off

it's an expensive system starts at 300

bucks it's basically the same kind of

pricing as the m2 macbook air but this

has a beautiful screen super thin bezels

excellent image quality and it has an

infrared camera for facial biometrics to

log in the keyboard deck is very unique

it has a trackpad that is basically

invisible there's no beginning and end

to it it's just this middle area that

has the kind of trackpad capabilities it

uses haptics like a macbook it's nice to

use and just looks so nice and the

keyboard also unique looking but it's a

very nice keyboard to type on this is

just a kick-ass system the ram is baked

on but you do get replaceable storage so

if you ever want to upgrade it down the

line or if something goes wrong you have

to replace it you have access to that

and you also have really nice speakers

these are

look way better than i expected and way

better than you would expect like of all

the thin windows devices i've used this

is seriously the best if you care about

audio this is one of very few windows

devices that has actually good speakers

in them it's strange that it's an xps

device but

the downside to this device is that the

gpu in here isn't great it's running

intel's iris xe chip and it's starting

to show its age uh same with battery

life so when you're doing light tasks

it's not bad but if you push the system

hard the energy inefficiency of intel's

chips starts to show this just cannot

keep up with apple's macbooks so it's a

great option but if battery life and or

gpu performance is extremely important

to you there are other options available

one of those is this thing here the asus

zenbook s13 so this is running amd's new

ryzen 6000 series chips and it's very

energy efficient and also has a very

capable graphics component the radeon

680m it does come in at thirteen hundred

dollars but it has 16 gigs of ram and

512 gigs of storage but the display is

an oled panel this thing looks really

nice so it's bright it's got very punchy

colors it's nice for watching videos

playing some casual games everything

looks really vibrant on this panel now

the keyboard is a solid keyboard it's

comfortable to type on it's pretty easy

to get used to but the trackpad down

here has this neat feature where you can

hit this button down here which enables

this number pad which could use for some

rapid fire number crunching the cpu in

here is fast but it's best for short

bursts of multi-core performance and the

gpu is also strong it is a lower water

system so it's not going to max out its

full potential but it's kind of

comparable to the m2 gpu and because

this system has a fan it can sustain a

reasonable amount of performance for an

extended period of time now inside the

ram is also baked on like pretty much

all 13-inch devices these days but the

storage is replaceable now the battery

is big and the battery life is very good

it's not as good as a macbook but for a

system with an oled panel this is a very

energy efficient device okay um

so this is a solid option if you want

something that has a good gpu and really

good battery life but both of those

systems that i've shown so far are quite

expensive if you're looking for

something that's a little bit cheaper

this is something i think fits the

ticket so this is the hp aero13 it's

also running an amd apu now this

particular model is running the 5000

series chips i imagine they're going to

update this to the 6000 series chips in

the very near future but what makes it

special is the price so this is 850

that's like the regular price and i've

seen it as low as like 600 bucks uh

great keyboard great

performance but display dude so

this is a very bright very colorful 16

by 10 aspect ratio screen normally when

you have a device that's under a

thousand bucks like windows laptops you

do not get good screens it's like one of

the easiest places i can start to strip

away the quality and present a product

that's just not great

but this at 850 bucks when it's not on

sale is a fantastic screen and just a

fantastic device overall the battery

life can't keep up with the more

expensive devices but for this price

point i'd consider to be excellent there

are a few things that aren't great on it

the speakers aren't particularly good

and the 512 gig drive in here at least

on this particular unit it's on the

slower side but it is replaceable if you

want to get in there and pop it out in

regards to the m1 macbook air it's

interesting to me that they didn't drop

the price so normally when apple comes

up with a new version of something

they'll drop the price of the older

version

and they didn't this time around so if

you think about when this thing came out

like the m1 air this was like 20 20

november so it's been like

a year and a half not quite two years

but it's right it's definitely an aged

product but it's still coming in at the

999 price point that this thing launched

at

and the thing is this is still a

fantastic laptop and if you remove

yourself from that pursuit of like the

latest and greatest in technology the m1

macbook air does all the fundamentals

really well it's got a great keyboard

great display great performance really

good battery life like this nails a lot

of stuff perfectly

it's just that the bezels are thick but

if you have a budget of a thousand bucks

you can't go beyond it i wouldn't sweat

it the m1 macbook air is still

it's really good it's like the giga chad

macbook this is really something special

now if you uh if you've seen my previous

videos i've talked about the m2 macbook

pro extensively i'm not going to go into

too much detail but if you have a

workflow that needs you know heavy

performance for an extended period of

time m2 macbook pro does better than the

m2 macbook air because that thing has a

fan this does not now just wrap this

video up with just

one thought um

okay

i think a lot of this conversation today

exists because

this product the m2 macbook air bumped

up in price

by 20 30 percent because if it didn't

like imagine apple decided that this

would be a thousand dollar machine and

they bumped this thing down to like

eight or nine hundred bucks it would

have been great for apple users because

this new macbook air wouldn't have cost

anything more but it would have a huge

impact on the windows laptop market

in fact i feel like if that had happened

i would have reached out to some

companies

do you want to participate in the m2

macbook comparison

they'd all been like nah we're good

i really think that okay there you go

the m2 macbook comparison

"
6,The M2 13in MacBook Air: A Year Later,"Introduction
the M2 MacBook Air is Apple's latest
MacBook Air redesign and now well it's a
year old a lot can change within a
single year so let's talk about this
laptop and whether you should consider
it or not let's get started the M2 2022
MacBook Air is Apple's cheapest laptop
with their M2 chips despite that it does
pack some pretty nice features but the
How’s the Laptop Body after a Year?
most standout feature on basically any
MacBook Air is
how light that they are for the last
year this thing has been tossed around
used everywhere and as much as I'd hate
to admit it even eaten around too not
often but but yeah it's been an absolute
Workhorse it's thin light and every time
I begin to use my 14 inch MacBook Pro
again I really miss how light the M2
13-inch air is it really feels like a
big tablet instead of a laptop in your
hand and I really really like that using
it every day spoils you on how light it
really is compared to the other MacBooks
to the point that I even sometimes
forget that I packed the laptop in my
backpack but like I mentioned in the
last video the Finish around the ports
are slowly chipping away to reveal a
more bare silver look basically all the
little accidental Nicks and scratches on
the body will show up over time so if
you're not delicate with it the midnight
finish will start to show signs of wear
and this laptop is still a massive
fingerprint magnet let me show you what
I mean I wiped it Down clean here and if
I just scrape my hand across it
you'll see the streaks up here right
here but some people actually like the
wear and tear look on the computer and
thinks it adds character I don't but you
do you the rest of the body has held up
pretty well and after 122 battery Cycles
the M2 MacBook Air still has 97 of its
battery capacity left and from my own
personal experience I've had Max in the
past at the year mark actually start to
break down whether this be USB C ports
being non-responsive to webcams failing
it's a quick battery wear and so far I
really haven't seen that with these M2
MacBook airs the laptop still functions
like the day I bought it alright do
treat it pretty delicately but there has
also been some times when it's
accidentally falling off of tables or
bedsides because sometimes I use a USBC
port for charging and the robot vacuum
in my house snag the USBC cable pulling
the laptop to the floor so learn from my
mistakes so it doesn't happen to you
while you can charge it through USBC you
probably want to charge it through
magsafe as much as possible because
magsafe safely detaches once a certain
amount of pressure is applied I said
earlier that the MacBook Air is really
really light and while that is normally
a really good thing it can also be a
negative especially when the rubber feet
on this laptop isn't all that great so
this laptop feels like it's on ice
skates constantly so charging through
magsafe would be my recommendation and
plus that opens up your other two ports
to be used for other things that you
might want to plug into if you use this
M2 MacBook Air or any laptop in general
you know how underwhelming the webcams
can be that's where this video sponsor
the Opel C1 comes into play the Opel C1
is a 4K webcam designed for Macs that
has the approval of some of your
favorite creators like MKBHD Sarah dichi
and Casey neistat this webcam has
premium feeling aluminum all around the
entire body it's premium looking and was
actually designed by Kenny sweet the guy
who designed the first Beats by Dre and
pixel watch I like how minimal it looks
with no giant logos or crazy colors
demon scrolling that comes out of the
opal C1 is fantastic and when you
compare it to the image quality out of
the MacBooks it just blows is my
macbook's webcam out of the water but
the real game changer is in the software
the Opel composer the Opel composer can
be used in conjunction with the Opel C1
to really tweak and dial in the image
you want out of the webcam for that
perfect look like white balance how much
back rumbler you want or even adding in
effects the Stellar image quality and
customizability in this tiny premium
feeling package makes it really hard for
me to look at my Max built-in webcam the
same as I did before without
acknowledging that it's lacking all of
these great features so you're
interested in the opal C1 or want to
learn more about it leave a link in the
video description box below anyway let's
What Upgrades Are Worth it?
talk about the rest of the MacBook the
M2 MacBook Air that I've been showing on
this screen and tossing around here is
the base model version with eight gigs
of RAM and 256 gigabytes of storage now
these sound and look limiting on paper
and the storage is half the speed of all
the other storage sizes now the Target
demographic who's buying this machine
won't notice those differences but it's
worth noting the shortcomings of this
lab laptop in case you do fall out of
the typical user for this kind of laptop
Apple utilizes memory swapping on their
apple silicon Max meaning once you fill
up your eight gigabytes of RAM with
those 32 Chrome tabs you have open the
laptop will begin treating your
computer's storage as extra Ram the
thing is RAM is super fast ssds have
been getting faster and they are way
faster than just standard hard drives
but it's still slower than Ram by having
a slower SSD in the base model MacBook
Air you're more likely to experience
slowdowns especially if you're the type
of person to have a ton of apps open or
do some intensive tasks also Ram is
meant to be written to and wiped
constantly and SSD is not meant to be as
frequent as RAM think of ram like what
you're remembering in the moment your
short-term memory it's constantly
changing versus your SSD which is more
like a core memory of your embarrassing
first day of kindergarten it's there
it's always been there and it always
will be so this memory swapping does
increase wear on the max SSD and apple
does not make it easy to replace and
repair a dead SSD on their laptops
especially on their newer machines
unless you just so happen to double
major in medical surgery and Engineering
so if you have to make any upgrade to
the M2 MacBook Air or any base model
MacBook with only 256 gigabytes of
storage go for the 16 gigabytes of RAM
if you need more storage you can always
just buy an external SSD and it's much
cheaper than what Apple charges you for
that storage upgrade you might have the
burden of carrying it around with you
but it can outlive your laptop and can
also be used on your next laptop too
How’s the Base Model Performance after a Year?
okay enough about the physical features
and specs of the laptop how is it like
in everyday performance well see this
thing hasn't really let me down yet I
find it really useful as a lightweight
companion for General productivity but I
also end up using it kind of like a
tablet too like for watching YouTube
videos video streaming or having
reference materials up when I'm playing
video games for when I can't figure out
a puzzle that was designed for a 10 year
old I don't really use use the M2
MacBook Air much to get my YouTube stuff
done because I have dedicated desktop
for that but when I had to use it for
those tasks it's handled my video
editing and photo editing just fine I
don't think my video workflow is super
intensive just don't go expecting that
you're gonna make the next hit
Blockbuster film on this laptop alone
gaming on this thing on another hand I
just wouldn't recommend at all not
because I can't handle some really light
gaming it's just that supports for games
for the M series Max it's just not good
it's slowly getting better Apple has
been making some inroads on this but
don't expect the game on here unless
it's using something like Remote Play or
steam link the M2 Chip in this laptop
does not heat up in basic tasks in
general productivity but it does get
warm during charging or when I do
something more graphically intensive
like video editing it's just the nature
of things this thing may be fanless but
it does get pretty warm I don't think
I've experienced a situation where this
laptop was was hot also all these
non-pro Macs only support One external
monitor you don't really notice it with
this MacBook Air since it's kind of a on
the go type of machine anyway and I
don't think I was ever in a situation
where I personally wanted to plug in
more than a single external monitor to
this thing but if you are you might want
to consider the MacBook Pro 14-inch
instead now that's too rich for your
blood there are these docks that can
enable this through third-party software
but that can be hit or miss and cost a
decent chunk of change too so if you're
considering any Apple computer that
doesn't have a pro Max or Ultra chip be
sure that you're okay with this one
external monitor limitation or else you
should look at those machines instead so
Conclusion - Would I Have Purchased This Again?
speaking of other MacBooks what I have
purchased this M2 MacBook Air with
basically all the knowledge that I know
now a lot has happened in the last year
since this 13-inch MacBook Air was
released Apple released a 15-inch
MacBook Air which is just this guy but a
little bit bigger you know what I'm
saying wider you know what I'm saying
yeah and when doing that they lowered
the price of the 13 inch down to just
eleven hundred dollars that put it at
just 100 dollars more than the last
generation M1 MacBook Air and 200 less
than the 15-inch MacBook Air and before
this recent price cut I recommended the
M1 MacBook Air because it's budget
friendly had some good enough
performance and cost 200 less than the
M2 MacBook Air but now the M1 MacBook
Air feels kind of ancient that thing was
released in late 2020 and it's still for
sale and the M2 is only a little more in
terms of price for a bunch of nice
little quality of life upgrades like a
newer design convenience and safety of
magsafe charging and a faster chip these
slightly improved features make using it
a little nicer and if you're using the
laptop long term I think it's worth it
to just pay up the hundred dollars to
get the M2 MacBook Air since this newer
machine will have software updates for a
little longer too I don't think I could
recommend purchasing the M1 MacBook Air
new anymore unless you find a really
really good deal for it there have been
some recently but this M2 MacBook Air
has served my own uses perfectly fine
I'd recommend it for casual laptop users
focused on productivity personal
entertainment and office type tasks this
machine doing all those things is pretty
good and even if you're a hobbyist
that's getting into photo editing or
video editing this could still be a
pretty good machine there's rumors of a
newer model in October and if that's the
case this one will be on sale for an
even better price or you can just wait
to get the latest version instead anyway
what do you personally think are you
considering buying this laptop with all
the back to school deals and sales that
are going on right now are you waiting
for the M3 version instead what other
laptops are you looking at did this
long-term review actually help you
because I'm not sure that I'm going to
keep doing these like one year reviews
in the future unless they are actually
pretty helpful they are then maybe I'll
keep doing them leave all that in the
comment section below and if you enjoyed

7,M2 MacBook Air Review - Needs More Air,"eight months ago when rumors of the m2

macbook air first started to come out i

was convinced that this was going to be

the machine that i buy and use as my

regular machine like i was so certain

that i would be an m2 macbook air user

because new m2 chip new form factor

really nice design aesthetics on those

leaks

but having gone this thing in it's a

really good machine but it's not quite

what i expected now my review unit is

this midnight color it's like a dark

blue finish i like the look of it and

when i unbox it it also came with this

braided magsafe cable that is color

matched it's also a midnight colored

magsafe cable and also it came with

color matched apple stickers as well as

the 35 watt dual charger now this is an

optional accessory that comes with the

upgraded versions of m2 macbook air but

it has two ports for charging multiple

devices so this is a very nice looking

machine it's got the design aesthetics

of the bigger 14 and 16 inch devices but

it's thinner and lighter and it comes in

this wicked blue color

uh this is if i'm not mistaken the first

macbook that apple has made that has had

a dark metal finish like we've seen dark

plastic macbooks but never something as

dark as this i like the look of it but

the fingerprints are everywhere like you

just touch it for a little bit and just

smudges and fingerprints just start

appearing it's not uncommon with dark

colored metal laptops like the razer

blades get covered like this as well but

if you're sensitive to this stuff you go

for a lighter color or get a skin to go

over it on the top there are two usb-c

ports on the left these support

thunderbolt 4 but it still only supports

one display out there's also the magsafe

connection on that side and then on the

right you have the high impedance

headphone jack now on the bottom of the

new macbook air

the feet look a little bit different

these are kind of in the style of the

new 14 and 16 inch uh macbook pros

it's just like a minor difference but i

gotta say i like this new one more it's

also an even bottom like the previous

generation had a taper to it but this is

like a flat bottomed

m2 macbook air okay let's talk about

performance so the chip that's in here

in the air is the same chip

technically as the one that's in the m2

macbook pro underneath there

but the performance is a little bit

different if you only look at short

benchmarks the m2 macbook air is still

about a 10 or 15 bump over m1 and same

with the gpu it's like 35 maybe 40

better than m1 but because the m2

macbook pro has a fan it can remove heat

that builds up over time this device

doesn't the only way it can get rid of

the heat is just to radiate it outwards

and let your environment get rid of it

and the result is that the m2 macbook

air is not good at maintaining a high

level of performance for an extended

period of time i noticed that if you

push the cpu and only the cpu it'll get

to like five or six minutes before it

starts to throttle if you're pushing

everything you're going like maximum

effort cpu and gpu going full tilt it's

like three to four minutes and you'll

start to notice some heavy throttling so

the m2 macbook air has a fast processor

but if you compare to the m2 macbook pro

with its fan depending on the workflow

and how long you're pushing the system

at maximum effort for

this can start to slow down

significantly now

the thing to keep in mind is that people

who are buying this system like people

who are looking at an m2 macbook air

product as their regular computer

they're not people adding like 8k

films and like compiling huge projects

like that's just not the regular

workflow that goes into a system like

this there are way more powerful tools

from apple if that's your workflow but i

was just surprised at how big of a

difference there was between the fanless

system and the fan equipped system on

the m2 product like when the m2 macbook

pro first came out and people were just

looking at the reviews there's a

conversation of like oh who's gonna buy

that thing who's it for well

i don't know man a little bit of airflow

goes a long way when it comes to this

chip it's also very noticeable in games

even the moderately demanding titles

don't do as well on the m2 macbook air

compared to the m2 macbook pro the new

macbook air just needs a little bit more

air uh okay a quick note on the storage

and the controversy that's surrounding

it so

the base models of the m2 products like

both the the pro and the air coming in

256 gigs of storage but this year

they're only using a single nand for

that drive so it results in

significantly slower drive speeds when

you're running a drive speed benchmark

now there's concern over this because

apple silicon performance can sometimes

lean quite heavily on fast drives like

if you have a big project and you don't

have a lot of ram and it's doing some

disk swapping it can hurt performance in

a noticeable manner the thing is i think

the vast majority of people on an m2

macbook air are not working on crazy big

projects with like 10 chrome tabs open

it's just not a thing and even if you

are working with huge video files you're

probably using one of the bigger drives

that don't have these reduced speeds i

think regular workflows and even

moderately demanding creative workflows

are going to be fine on the system that

being said i think that their 512 gig

storage option costing an extra 200

is criminal i think that's just nuts but

also i think if they're gonna have

slower drive speeds on those entry level

models they need to disclose that it

should be on the website like maybe not

plastered on the options but like in the

fine print even it should be available

for people to look at because that's

just information people need to know

okay the display this is running a 13.6

inch display it's a really nice panel

there is a notch and for the people that

are just new to the whole idea of the

notch you get used to it you can hide it

if you want and it's just extra screen

real estate at the top for the menu bar

it's still a 60 hertz panel so no pro

motion but it's bright the colors are

good and the bezels are nice and thin

now now this is a review unit that i

can't open up like i can't pop it open

to show you the internals but it's a

fanless system so there's probably not

much to look at anyways i used a thermal

camera on the m2 macbook air and this

thing gets warm warmer than i thought it

would so the back area gets around 40

degrees celsius like just right in the

middle and it radiates like outwards

like you would expect but on the flip

side like the keyboard deck area this

gets just as warm but it's never

uncomfortable to use now the keyboard is

arguably the best keyboard that's ever

been in a macbook air this is a nice

keyboard spacious nice to type on nice

travel uh it's just

i think this is the way that every

laptop keyboard should be it's just a

fantastic keyboard it also has the

fingerprint sensor on the top right

which works well like you'd expect from

apple the webcam on the top is a 1080p

webcam this has good image quality and

it is noticeably better than the one on

the m2 macbook pro uh speaker system so

there's four speakers

and they're great the shocking thing to

me is how good they're able to get like

the mid frequencies and lower

frequencies like the bassy stuff on a

system so thin like there are gaming

laptops that are probably five times

thicker than this that don't sound as

good it's bizarre but apple does their

speakers really well battery life was

good for my testing it's a little bit

less than the m2 macbook pro but still

super solid and again it's amazing how

much better apple's battery life on

their laptops is compared to any of the

windows competitors out there like they

do a fantastic job with energy

efficiency my review unit came with this

35 watt adapter and it takes about an

hour to charge this thing fully with

this adapter but they do have a optional

67 watt adapter that juices it up in i

think like 30 minutes but i did connect

just a usbc cable to the usbc port uh

and you can get up to 70 watts from my

testing through that port so my overall

take on the m2 macbook air this is a

fantastic device for people looking for

something that can handle light to

moderately demanding work but if you're

someone that wants like a very powerful

system and you're hoping that something

super thin and super light can handle it

unfortunately i would say that it can't

it's it's weird that just the presence

of a fan makes such a big difference in

terms of sustained workflow i was

surprised by it but

that's just the nature of the m2 chip

it's just a more demanding chip than the

previous generation okay there you have

it the m2 macbook air

"
8,M2 MacBook Air LONG TERM Review | Still the BEST Laptop?,"Physical aspects & screen
I've been using the M2 MacBook Air for
about nine months now and I think it's
the perfect laptop for most people but
is it still worth getting it now or
should you wait for M3 and also what
about the 14-inch MacBook Pro and
competition on the Windows side I
personally feel like this laptop should
definitely be among the top contenders
for your next laptop since in the last
nine months that I've spent with it
there has been very little
disappointments and mostly pleasant
surprises mine has physically held up
pretty well I haven't dropped it or
anything but I do bring it around in a
backpack pretty often and I don't use a
sleeve or case it's still pretty much in
pristine condition there's no visible
scratches or dents anywhere I also love
how thin and light this laptop is even
though it's a lot thinner than the
MacBook Pros it feels just a solid to
work on this thing on a desk on my lap
and compared to the 14 inch I would say
this one really doesn't feel any smaller
there's actually only an 0.6 inch
difference diagonally between those
screens but personally I don't really
like how both of the Thunderbolt ports
on the MTM MacBook Air are on the same
side sometimes it makes charging this
thing a bit awkward since I have to wrap
the cable around it and also it being
able to only drive one monitor is a
pretty notable downside versus the
MacBook Pros now I have seen some online
posts about the bottom plate bending but
I haven't noticed this issue myself the
bottom of this is still perfectly fine
and it feels very solid and the keyboard
deck on this thing might Flex ever so
slightly more than the MacBook Pros but
honestly it's so slight that you barely
feel it even with the side by side and I
think it makes no difference in
day-to-day use the keyboard still feels
really good compared to other Windows
laptops that I've played with this is
probably the most rigid and solid
feeling laptop the hinge also didn't
loosen over time it's so great holds the
screen in all sorts of angles the only
other aspect that one might consider it
to be behind its competition is the
display because it's becoming more and
more common for Windows laptops to have
OLED and 120 hertz and so this regular
LC LCD display might not seem that
competitive at least on paper however
there are actually many situations where
I prefer this display this screen can go
much brighter than most OLED ones out
there and on top of that the MacBook
anti-reflection coating is just much
better than the other windows ones that
I've seen and so in the end this
combination actually makes it a very
usable laptop Outdoors which is
definitely a plus and I feel like the
500 nits on the M2 MacBook Air is a
pretty notable upgrade over the 400 nit
screen on the M1 MacBook Air
surprisingly I had a very hard time
telling apart this display versus the
mini LED display on the MacBook Pro now
of course if you're under low ambient
light conditions and watching some HDR
OLED show reels or just HR content in
general then it's very obvious that the
mini LED delivers pure blacks and also
much brighter highlights but if you're
just playing some regular videos like
mine and you're in a moderately lit room
then I think you'll have a very hard
time telling them apart and given how
rare HDR content is currently you're
really not missing out on much with this
LCD display and another benefit of an
Apple display is that it's quite
consistent with all other Apple displays
in color and tone whereas each window
OLED seems to have like a personality of
its own but I do feel like I'm kind of
missing out on the 120 hertz when 60 and
120 hertz are side by side I feel like
it's pretty easy to notice even things
like just moving the cursor around feels
smoother on the 120 hertz display but
when I'm just using the MacBook Air on
its own it feels perfectly fine I don't
really think about how it can be
smoother now the elephant in the room
about the display is the notch I've
definitely seen some comments hitting on
it but honestly it's never bothered me
much either aesthetically or
functionally there's still plenty of
room in the menu bar for items I have
quite a few installed and even if you
hate the look of it you can hide it
pretty easily with this app called Top
Notch it basically just turns the top
part black so the top bezel is just much
thicker but you're not wasting any space
because the menu bar does sit on top of
it even though the the display is not
mini LED with top notch on it still gets
dark enough such that the notch no
longer stands out the notch at least
somewhat justifies its existence with
some pretty good 1080p webcams and since
there's already a notch I think adding
face ID would be pretty cool too but to
be fair I don't think the notch is the
best solution because there are many
other Windows laptops that will Jam both
the webcam and the face ID into a much
thinner bezel but besides that
subjectively I'm a big fan of this
design I love this new shape over the
wedge and the thick bezels on the M1 air
but more objectively you know the slight
reduction in the way and the small
increase in screen will say the slight
reduction in thickness doesn't set it
significantly apart from the last gen in
terms of the physical design however Max
save is actually pretty notable and not
just for the safety aspect of it but
also in that it now allows for fast
charge at up to 67 Watts which has
definitely come in handy for me a few
times and one last thing about the
design is the hidden speakers so without
a direct speaker Grille it does sound
worse than the MacBook Pros and the M1
MacBook Air for my memory but honestly
in my nine months of use I rarely use
these speakers most of the time when I
am using the speakers I'm watching
lectures at home and for those times
it's perfectly intelligible but the
removal of the grills does make it
slightly easier to clean and I also
think it looks cleaner overall so I feel
like I'm more okay with their removal
now but that's just my opinion battery
Battery life
life of this computer is another aspect
that I really came to appreciate I would
also appreciate if you subscribed first
of all after nine months of use I didn't
notice any meaningful battery life
degradation and actually just a few days
ago I did a full drain test of it
looping 4K YouTube videos and it lasted
over 10 hours this is the longest
lasting laptop of the size that I've
ever used there's a pretty big gap
between it and the Windows laptops when
I'm not trying to do heavy tasks on this
thing like editing a video it frequently
last lasts well over a day if I'm not
like spending the entire day on it and
most of the time I don't bring a charger
around because I'm pretty confident that
it will last through the entire day but
it definitely does string significantly
faster if I'm doing something heavy like
editing a video on it in general the M2
SOC doesn't drain that much power
typically when I have a bunch of tabs
open and I'm playing a 4K video it's
only using about six to seven watts and
when I'm doing a heavier task like
rendering a video it only draws around
20 watts so even if battery life is a
big concern for your day-to-day use even
a medium-sized battery Bank can quite
significantly increase the total run
time and as for the performance so I
Performance
have the absolute base model here with
eight GPU cores and only eight gigs of
RAM but it's still pleasantly surprised
me with just how capable this thing is
with lighter tasks like web browsing
some text document work it does not seem
to run into any performance limits ever
and for a more extreme workload here
year I have it connected to an external
5K display with over 20 tabs loaded and
a 4K video playing it still feels
extremely smooth when I'm navigating
around there's no hiccups when I scrub
through the video it basically feels
just as responsive as if there's nothing
running on it but at this point it's
using some swap which couldn't be good
for the longevity of the SSD so unless
you don't really multitask I would still
recommend upgrading to 16 gigs of RAM
but I would not recommend the GPU
upgrade I have more detailed testing in
my review video here but the gist is
that as a fanless device it's just not
going to be a GPU Workhorse if you're
thinking about getting a new Macbook to
render faster or just do other more GPU
intensive things than the MacBook Pros
are still going to be much better
options also the SSD and the base model
M2 air is slower but that's never been
an issue in my use alright and speaking
of editing so with only eight gigs of
RAM it begins to slow down pretty
noticeably if you have many tops opened
and you're trying to edit at the same
time but if you're just editing then the
performance is actually pretty decent
you can cut up 4K Clips just fine move
them around when you go to render it it
does thermal throttle so it becomes a
bit slow but if you're just editing
occasionally I wouldn't really go for
the 13-inch MacBook Pro to save on those
couple of minutes however there are a
lot of features in editing that this
thing is just way too underpowered to do
like denoising stabilizing long Clips
tracking a subject so it's not quite
enough for more complicated edits
overall as a thin and light device this
is really great but it's also up against
some pretty stiff competition notably
Apple still sells the M1 MacBook Air on
its website for 200 less considering
that it feels about as fast for common
and light tasks and also lasts just as
long it's quite compelling in value but
this M2 MacBook Air does bring a better
webcam also a brighter display and a Mac
Safe Port I think if you're not editing
a video on this thing or a software
engineer that needs every bit of
performance possible then whichever one
you choose is going to be with you for a
really long time so it might be worth it
to spend a bit more to get the newer and
more updated design and also the
Creature Comforts and the same logic
applies to the Future M3 MacBook Air as
well even if the M3 Chip is going to be
20 faster I doubt the average user is
going to feel it when they're just
browsing the web and working on text
documents and on the design side first
of all I think it's extremely unlikely
that they're going to put out a new
design on a computer that they just
redesigned and I mean what more could
you ask for the design anyways a mini
LED 120hz display would certainly be
nice but I think that's reserved for the
pro lineup so the MacBook Air might
never get that so I think there's
nothing that special to wait for but let
me know what you guys think that's going
to be it for this video subscribe if you

9,Base model M2 MacBook Air 9 months later - How did it hold up??,"so nine months ago I picked up the base
model M2 MacBook Air and I loved it and
if you love something very much A lot
can happen in nine months let's ramble
when I pull up they all on me like it
once hey what's up guys it's great to
see you all again and if you're new here
I'm Patrick and this is where I ramble
about tech and other stuff so yeah when
the M2 MacBook Air was announced in June
of last year I immediately picked one up
to review for the channel and I decided
to order the base model because that
tends to be the model most people are
interested in and I wanted to see what
it was capable of the other reason I
wanted to review the base model
specifically is that soon after the
launch some of the larger channels
started dropping videos about how
terrible the base model was and that you
shouldn't buy it and I thought those
reviews were incredibly unfair and this
is what I had to say about it nine
months ago oh my God the machine slows
down when you run multiple streams of 8K
no people need to relax nine months
later I said what I said and I stand by
it now we will get back to the
performance issue a little later on in
the video but first let's have a look at
how this thing actually held up over
time so the design in my opinion is
still stunning I went for the midnight
color because let's be honest it is the
best color Yes it smudges it smudges
very very badly and if you have any kind
of ambition to keep this thing pristine
you're gonna have to carry around a
microfiber cloth wherever you go but hey
at least that finally gives me a reason
to show off my Swanky Apple microfiber
cloth that came with my studio display
remember the hype when these came out
ridiculous anyway it doesn't only smudge
it also scratches and it chips pretty
easily and that does seem to be
particularly true for the midnight color
or maybe it just shows better on this
color I'm not sure with that said this
one has hardly any scratches on it but
to be fair I kind of baby it I make sure
I always use some kind of bag or sleeve
when I bring it with me and I found the
perfect one to keep it safe this
zippered Sleeve by Harbor London has a
really soft and thick lining so there's
no way you're going to scratch the
MacBook it's super light and the
exterior is made of recycled bottles so
you don't need to panic about a bit of
rain or maybe a spilled drink I love how
thin the MacBook Air is and every time I
grab it even after nine months I can't
believe how light this feels my
Workhorse is a 14 inch M1 MacBook Pro
and even though that's a pretty compact
machine as well this one feels like half
a laptop compared to that the downside
of that is that it takes zero effort to
yank this one off the table and to be
honest the rubber feet on the bottom do
absolutely nothing to prevent that
that's why I'm happy that the air comes
with the new magsafe charging port and I
would definitely advise you to use that
if there is any chance at all of
tripping over your wire with that said
I'm glad it also charges via USBC and
that will give you fast charging as well
I'm super happy that Apple kept the full
row of function keys but it does mean
that there are no speaker grilles on the
chassis and you can definitely tell the
speakers are decent for a laptop but
they pale in comparison to the speakers
on the MacBook Pro

[Music]
[Music]
the liquid Retina display is nice but
again it doesn't come close to the
liquid Retina xdr display on the MacBook
Pro lineup the airs display has only 60
hertz refresh rate which is definitely
noticeable and it tops out at 500 nits
which is fine for indoor use but not so
great in bright sunlight speaking of
displays if you're used to running a
dual monitor setup you're out of luck
with the M2 MacBook Air of course there
are third-party workarounds but out of
the box this MacBook supports a single
external display only for me personally
that's totally fine while my M1 MacBook
Pro is docked and hooked up to an
external display 99 of the time I use
the M2 MacBook Air as an actual laptop
most of the time my ideal use case is to
grab it stick it in a bag and take it
with me on trips and commutes and when I
get back to the office I hook it up to a
hub and the monitor I recently got this
thing here sent to me for review and
this is what I call a base station I
want to keep my desk setups as minimal
as possible and the Prisma 3 in 1 does
exactly that it functions as a
multi-purpose shelving unit so I can
keep all the stuff that I need often
like pens memory cards my wallet you
name it I love that it has a lid so I
don't need to look at all the
knickknacks cluttering up my desk right
next to it is a charging station for my
iPhone delivering 15 watts of power
giving it a nice and quick charge but
the coolest part for Tech nerds like you
and me is when you press this button
here an entire functional Hub extends
out of the base station giving you all
sorts of ports including an SD card
which is of course great for creatives
and an HDMI port so this thing literally
functions as the Hub between my MacBook
Air and this huge 48 inch OLED display
which I will talk more about in a future
video so if you're into that kind of
stuff hit that subscribe button that
would be much appreciated to top it all
off you can take the Hub part off of
this thing toss it in the back alongside
the MacBook Air and use it as a hub
wherever you go very cool product I'll
put a link in the description and let me
know if you want me to review it for you
in a bit more detail so after nine
months how good is the base model well
the short answer is that for basic users
it's absolutely fine the battery life is
outstanding at normal usage meaning not
rendering video files all day I easily
get 10 to 14 hours out of this thing
which is simply fantastic you can't
complain about that earlier in the video
I said that there was a real Trend
across YouTube Tech channels of bashing
the base model M2 MacBook Air but all
that hate is based on unrealistic
scenarios where people would get the
base model and then throw the most
insane tasks added that even a MacBook
Pro would struggle with that's simply
not realistic with that said the base
model does have a bottleneck that can
slow down the machine when it's under
heavy load the reason for that is that
the base model comes with only 8
gigabytes of unified memory and 256
gigabytes of storage and that storage is
based on a single nand chip now if you
try hard enough even as a regular user
you can use up the 8 gigabytes of RAM by
keeping open a lot of chrome tabs for
example and a bunch of apps running in
the background at the same time once the
MacBook does use all the ram it will use
the SSD memory for swap purposes and
because the SSD is slower since it only
has the one Nan chip the entire process
will be slower there's also no fans in
this machine and while that's very
pleasant most of the time because it's
super quiet it can cause thermal
limitations when the machine is under
stress now should you upgrade the SSD or
the Ram from the base model if you do
need to run more demanding tasks the
answer to that is almost always Ram
while upgrading the SSD from the base
configuration will help with memory swap
you'll still have only 8 gigabytes of
unified memory it's better to double the
ram so there's little to no need for
swapping in the first place I did a
separate video dedicated to answering
just that question so if you're
interested that I'll put a link to that
video at the end of this one do not
upgrade the GPU course those are useful
for long and heavy loads like video
editing and 3D work and that's just not
what this M2 error is good at it's not
what it was built to do if this is what
you need get the M1 Pro or the M2 Pro if
that's in your budget it has way more
cores it has two fans so the performance
will be much better and the price
difference with the M1 MacBook Pro after
upgrading the M2 MacBook Air is really
not that big these days but again if
you're a regular user you shouldn't even
be worried about these things and the
base model will serve you just fine and
when I'm using the M2 MacBook Pro myself
I know it's limitation so I use it for
normal computer things I use it to
browse the web I love sitting on the
couch with this thing on my lap and I
use it for all kinds of office work I
handle my emails I take care of my
accounts I do client work for my other
business there's no video work or
anything like that involved 99 of what I
sent my clients in that business will be
in the form of PDFs and here I would
like to give a huge shout out to you PDF
which is the best free pdf editing tool
out there and it is definitely my PDF
app of choice and thank you so much to
them for sponsoring this part of the
video apart from the fact that it is a
super solid product you can also use it
across platforms on Mac Windows IOS and
Android with just one license of course
you can read and annotate PDFs but it
does much more than that it has a really
powerful editor on board which to me
personally that is the most important
feature I've tried a lot of editors over
the years and usually it's the editing
part where it gets messy and things move
when you don't want them to updf is
super clean you just hover over the text
you want to change and everything stays
exactly where it belongs of course it
also lets you fill out forms which is
another killer feature no matter what
business you're in it has a super easy
interface just a few clean toolbars and
what you see is what you get it's really
easy to organize Pages as well if you
need to change the order and when you're
done with the document you can either
save it back as a PDF or export it to
pretty much any file type you want
including Microsoft Word you can install
it for free and get the basic functions
or get a plan which is still a lot
cheaper than most other PDF editors plus
there's a link in the description with a
substantial discount I believe it's like
50 off so definitely check that out so
guys what I've been trying to tell you
is that this M2 MacBook Air has been an
absolute joy to use and I think you will
love it too as long as we're being
honest about what this is and don't have
unrealistic expectations of it this
machine is absolutely lovely it's light
it looks great the battery life is
superb it's super quiet it runs the
latest version of Mac OS and it does so
very Snappy it's not going to be a
Powerhouse and if you need a machine to
run your business and you're worried it
won't be able to handle your tasks get a
MacBook Pro there is a reason why that
one is called the pro and this one is
called the air guys if you enjoyed the
video please give it one of these it
really does make it difference subscribe

watching and see you in the next one

10,MacBook Air M2 After 10 Months: Here's What You Need To Know!,"this is the M2 MacBook Air and it's one
of the most misunderstood Macs out there
in my opinion there's a lot of negative
sentiment floating out there about this
machine and while the M2 air does have
its quirks I'm here to tell you that
most of that negativity couldn't be
further from the truth so with that said
let's get into it
[Music]
hey everyone Kyle Erickson here I'm
about the I bought that book air at
launch and it's been my daily driver up
until very recently for doing everything
from light productivity and design work
to really resource heavy stuff like
video editing coding and 3D modeling
after 10 months or so of using this
pretty much every day I can confidently
say that this laptop is capable of so
much more than you might think people
What's Misunderstood About the MacBook Air
seem to be fairly polarized on this
machine and either love it or hate it
and I think that stems from a few
different things one is going to be the
more superficial stuff like design and
wear basically anything that's more
Visual and two is on the performance in
a thing so let's kick things off with
the visual aspect first the model that I
Aesthetics & Design
have here is Starlight in color I've
mentioned this before but other than me
just having other Starlight products
like the iPad and just generally liking
lighter color products there's a few
advantages you get by having a lighter
model like this Starlight doesn't show
any fingerprints really at all in
anywhere around the ports or the color
can wear off on the aluminum from
repeated contact it's just a lot less
visible so I think having a lighter
color just reduces a perceived wear from
a visual perspective some people say
that they've seen a lot of wear on the
midnight models around the ports and
below the keyboard if they're wearing a
watch and the strap is hitting on there
but that really seems to be dependent on
the person using the machine I also know
folks who have the midnight version and
it's still in great condition so take
that for what it's worth if you are on
Portability
the go a lot with this and you put it in
situations where it can be prone to
contact that's something that you may
want to consider but outside of that
coming back to the on the go aspect of
this is where this machine kills it in
my opinion this is by far the lightest
slimmest MacBook available and it's
perfect for traveling or carting around
with you even if that's casually around
the house I've taken this with me on a
few trips and I much prefer hauling the
M2 air around with me versus the pro
models that are a little more bulky and
heavy there's one visual element that
pertains to the actual display between
the pro and the ear that I think is
quite misunderstood but before we touch
on that I want to take a minute to talk
about the sponsor of this video case
defy case Defy is known for their custom
CASETiFY
phone cases but they do offer a wide
range of products for different Apple
devices including MacBooks and iPads
that can help with some of the things
that I just mentioned case divide
provides 360 all-around protection both
on the device itself and the screen
which is beneficial to the overall
health of your devices I've got their
impact MacBook case and MacBook screen
protector along with the ultra impact
folio iPad case and iPad screen
protector it only takes a few seconds to
pop either the iPad or the MacBook into
each case provided you have everything
lined up and everything is nice and snug
once they're in place both cases have
these ecoshock corners on the MacBook
they're on the bracket lining providing
Superior impact protection and similarly
on the iPad case they cover the inside
edges and side corners and are great for
drop cushioning the MacBook screen
protector is magnetic and it just clips
into place so super easy to apply and
remove it filters out blue light up with
eyestrain and safeguards your privacy
which is super helpful especially in
public places the iPad case has an
adjustable horizontal stand for viewing
at different angles and the iPad screen
protector is made out of durable
tempered glass and that prevents against
scratches and cracking and still
maintains the iPad Sleek in slim design
I have the clear MacBook case and this
geometric pattern on the iPad case but
you can choose from a ton of different
prints or collections to customize these
to help represent the unique U these are
great quality I like the look of both of
them and if you're someone who is
looking for a case or protection for any
of your Apple products you can check out
casetify.com Kyle Erickson today and get
15 off of your purchase alright so back
Display
to the display I say this is pretty
misunderstood because of one specific
spec on the M2 air display versus the
pro there seems to be a general idea
floating out there that the pro screen
is way brighter than the air and I don't
find that to be particularly true the
pro can get to 1000 nits sustain
brightness and 1600 Peak but if you look
at the fine print that's in HDR content
only for SDR content which is what we're
looking at the majority of the time that
number is 500 nits matching the air sure
the pro does have a promotion 120 hertz
panel and it's smoother for scrolling in
motion at times but the blacks are a bit
deeper for sure but the air display is
no slouch it's got fantastic color
accuracy outstanding contrast for an IPS
panel and it's great for anything like
photo or video editing where you are
counting on color reproduction which I
think is something that you expect with
any Apple device these days I've never
really had any issues doing those tasks
like photo and video editing or really
anything for that matter and this is
another area where I see the base M2
error and the version that I have is
almost two different models you'll see a
Performance
lot of complaints about this machine
that seems to suggest that the M2 air is
severely restrictive and in most of
those cases it's when somebody picks up
the base model with eight gigs of RAM
and a 256 gig SSD interested to do all
this crazy stuff on it these crazy
benchmarks and tests are only applicable
to a very small portion of the
population most folks out there are just
looking for a new Mac and are just
answering emails opening spreadsheets
video calls just your average everyday
office tasks and media consumption
that's who that base model is for for
people who need more that just isn't
going to cut it a lot of the time I've
gone through tests on the channel here
where Photoshop can take up like seven
gigs of RAM editing Raw photos video
editing can eat that up quickly to esken
a bunch of different Power hungry apps
the version that I have I bought knowing
that I was gonna do all of those things
and in those instances You're Gonna Want
at least 16 gigs of RAM and 512 gigs or
more of storage usually but mine does
have 16 and 512 and I also bumped up the
M2 Chip from an a core GPU to 10 so this
machine that I have here I would say
only Loosely resembles the base model
and I think that's an important
distinction to make in real world
performance when you're not looking at
specs or benchmarks for most things it's
really hard to notice any difference
between the M2 error that I have here
and my M2 Pro Mac Mini with a one
terabyte SSD and 32 gigs of RAM even for
tasks like video editing and programming
I've done my fair share of coding on
this machine mostly for front-end stuff
either building JavaScript apps native
mobile apps and cross-platform react
native apps and most of the time
everything is buttery smooth with super
fast compile times keep in mind that
these apps are a lot of personal
projects their first smaller startups
and things like that whether it's not
huge processes or a ton of external
libraries or requirements but regardless
it's still very impressive on the more
creative end of things I've edited about
30 of these videos on the N2 air without
any issues at all that would include the
actual editing and Final Cut Pro and a
lot of photo editing and Lightroom and
Affinity photo for thumbnails and
Instagram posts sure if you get crazy
with your timeline and add a bunch of
Motion Graphics the arrow will start to
slow down on you but honestly 95 of the
time it's just as good as the M2 Pro
chip for most things I know the air
doesn't have any fans and it will warm
up a bit but I never found it to
throttle too much or even get
particularly hot outside of doing 3D
work 3D modeling and very GPU intensive
stuff is one area where it can tend to
struggle a bit but I'd say that's where
you start to get into pretty specific
use cases and even if it does slow down
doing those types of things it's still
usable for myself I don't have any
concerns with the longevity of the
machine because of heat the only thing
Long Term Battery Performance
that I'll say with those tasks is it
does really love to suck back the
battery life when it's going all out and
it does start throttling most of the
time with any low to mid draw tasks like
productivity basic software development
design work that kind of thing you get a
full day of battery on this no problem
even editing videos with a regular
timeline with some b-roll laid over it
here and there you don't generally have
to worry about things too much but when
you see that CPU load climb over 70 to
80 percent and it stays over that Mark
for an extended period of time you can
see that battery life get eaten up in
only a few hours again if you're doing
that kind of thing I would say it's
something where you're probably going to
have access to power and be using this
with an external monitor because both
video editing and 3D work aren't really
ideal on a laptop screen I will say
these latest machines hold their
long-term battery capacity way better
than those old Intel machines ever did I
remember always being paranoid about
leaving my MacBook plugged in at my desk
too long because it would kill the
battery it seemed like every year you'd
be swapping it out or paying for Battery
Service if you just left it plugged in
all the time with the M2 air I'm still
at 100 capacity coming up on a year and
I don't really notice any difference in
My overall battery life from when I
first got this so a huge one there as
MagSafe & Ports
well it's been super helpful that Apple
added the magsafe port back on the M2 as
well not that I really care how it
charge is but more because it frees up
an extra Port it used to be that I
absolutely needed a USB hub with the M1
errors in previous models because I'd
use one USBC port for power and the
other for an external Monitor and I used
to hate that when I was programming and
I needed to plug my phone into a machine
to test apps and all my ports were used
up I know it's still not great with only
two ports there but it is a lot more
Wireless Connectivity
functional when it comes to wireless
connectivity you've got Wi-Fi fi6 and
Bluetooth 5.0 which has worked well
enough in most instances I'd say that
now that I have a Wi-Fi 6E system and I
see some pretty big speed gains on the
new Wi-Fi 60 capable Pro machines I sort
of wish that this had it too but that's
really nitpicking and to notice those
changes you're likely going to need at
least a gigabit internet connection I
haven't had any weird drops or issues
with my airpods keyboards mice anything
at all that's all been Rock Solid and
honestly this machine has been an
absolute Beast for me I still use this a
Thoughts, Rumours & Prices
ton even with owning the new M2 Pro
machines it's super portable the screen
is great keyboard is great and I love
that it's dead silent if I would have
got the base model maybe I would have
been one of those folks with more of a
negative outlook on this laptop but that
is not the case and I think for me this
is definitely my personal favorite out
of any of the MAC machines that I've
used over the last year there's a lot of
rumors swirling about the next iteration
in the air coming with an M3 chip and an
OLED screen but for me I generally don't
like to read too much into that stuff
because a lot of the time it's just
plain wrong and you never really know
what's coming or when it's coming you
can find some pretty screaming deals on
the M2 MacBook Air these days both in
retail stores and if you head over to
the Apple refurb site you can grab them
at a discount there most of the time as
well and those are as good as new so
definitely a lot of value there if you
are someone who is looking for one of
Wrapping Up
these I know everyone's experience will
be different on this machine so please
if you own an M2 air or really any of
the M series machines I'd love for you
to leave a comment and let me know how
your experience has been with it or
maybe if you're considering picking one
of these up and why I know personally I
find this to be the perfect combo of
performance and portability the quality
is outstanding and I've had zero issues
with it so far well we'll see what the
next iteration of the air brings but for
now this is still my favorite all-around
Mac that's it for me thank you to
